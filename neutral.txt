6⭐️  Breathtaking Cinematography...Excellent Performances
5⭐️  Watch It For The Superb Performances!
6⭐️  Love of the era
4⭐️  First half is slow and sweet but second half is slowest only
4⭐️  Celluloid motion-picture romance..but sadly of no use!
6⭐️  A brave attempt but ultimately bloated and overwrought!
6⭐️  A slow paced but well directed off beat love saga which may find tough to please one and all.
6⭐️  Failed to meet expectations
